Clara:
================

Rough layout:

UI(s) <-----> Clara core <-----> AI framework
		   ^                    ^
		   |                    |
		   v                    v
		  Board and game framework

Main goal:
Develop a strong checkers and chess AI that is self-taught as much as possible

Eventual goal:
Intuitive terminal (ncurses) UI
Framework handling both checkers and chess games
Optimized game and board logic
Flexible AI framework
Optimized Minimax/game tree logic
Strong AI built with no teaching, relying only on ANNs, evolution, and unsupervised learning
Solid core uniting it all together

Present goals:

Design, code, and test a framework for representing boards and getting legal moves and the like
Design, code, and test a framework for representing games and handling game logic
Design and code a very simple AI (probably making random moves) to test the game framework
Design, code, and test a UI that allows the user to play against a simple AI
